For the javascript to work, you will have to create a file named settings.js on the `static/js` directory and declare the following variables in it:
* VERBOSE: if true, it will print incoming and outcoming data from the api.
* DISABLE_JS: if true, javascript will not be used.

Example:
```
var VERBOSE = false;
var DISABLE_JS = false;
```
