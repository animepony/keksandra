  <h1>Global moderation</h1>
  Any account have a numeric global role assigned to it. If this role is lesser
  than 4, it means the user is in the global staff.
  <br>
  Root: 0
  <br>
  Admin: 1
  <br>
  Volunteer: 2
  <br>
  Janitor: 3
  <br>
  Anything above 3 or undefined is considered a regular user. Janitors are able
  to delete any post or thread on the site and to close global reports.
  <br>
  Volunteers are able able to lift and issue any kind of global ban.
  <br>
  Admins are able to add or remove volunteers and janitors, to delete and
  transfer boards. They are also able to create boards when board creation is
  disabled.
  <br>
  Roots are able to assign admins.
  <br>
  The first admin or root will have to have it's role set using the terminal
  arguments. Consult the readme.md on src/be for instructions on that. Any role
  have all the powers of the less
  <span title="[TRIGGER WARNING] :^)">privileged</span> roles. When your account
  has access to the global staff tools, a link on your account page will be
  displayed.

  <h1>Board moderation</h1>
  A board have it's board owner and board volunteers. Board volunteers are added
  by the board owner and are able to delete content on the board, lock, pin,
  make threads cyclic, close board reports and apply bans for the board.
  <br>
  Board owners are able to do that, plus they are able to transfer or delete
  their own boards, add board banners, filters, custom css and rules and change
  the board settings.

  <h1>Custom CSS</h1>
  Board owners can add a css file to their boards, just using the upload form on
  the board management page. To delete the custom css file, click the upload
  button without entering any files.

  <h1>Reports</h1>
  Any non-banned user is able to report content, as long as said content haven't
  been reported yet.
  <br>
  Open reports will be displayed on the main moderation page with a link to the
  reported content and a button to close the report.
  <br>
  Closed reports are not deleted and they are available on the closed reports
  page.

  <h1>Deleting content</h1>
  As long as you are logged in, your global role and board role will be verified
  when you try to delete content AS LONG AS YOU DON'T INPUT A PASSWORD.
  <br>
  If you input a password, your account will not be validated and the system
  will try to use the deletion password you provided.

  <h1>Acessing moderation tools</h1>
  When you open a thread, there will be a link that will lead you to the
  moderation page for that board and thread, with all the moderation tools for
  that thread.

  <h1>Thread settings</h1>
  Threads have 3 settings: pin, lock and cyclic.
  <br>
  Pin will make a thread be listed above all others, no matter how long it was
  it's last bump.
  <br>
  Lock will prevent anyone from posting on a thread.
  <br>
  Cyclic will make the thread never get into auto-sage. Instead it will delete
  old posts when it hits the post limit that would trigger auto-sage.

  <h1>Bans</h1>
  To apply bans, select the checkboxes on the left top corner of postings and
  write an expiration for the ban. The date format must be parseable using the
  date parse of javascript.
  <br>
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse">Technical
    reference.</a>
  <br>
  Bans can be lifted from the bans page that can be accessed from the moderation
  pages.
  <br>
  Optionally, you can enter the ban reason and message. The ban message will be
  displayed on the post itself instead of the default ban message set in the
  site configurations. Global staff with the power to apply bans can select the
  checkbox to apply a global ban.
  <br>
  The ban reason will appear for both the user and on the bans list.

  <h1>Range bans</h1>
  It is also possible to ban entire IP ranges based on the first two parts of
  it. Notice that the range of the poster's ip can be seen on the moderation
  page for threads. Enter this range on the box in the range bans page and
  select to apply it.

  <h1>Hash bans</h1>
  Files can also be banned, keeping anyone from posting them. Copy the md5 of
  the file shown in the thread moderation page and input it on the hash bans
  page.

  <h1>Board settings</h1>
  There are many ways to customize how a board works in general.
  <br>
  Disable captcha will disable captcha for the board completely. Keep in mind
  that will expose the board to flood, since there are no anti-flood tools in
  place yet.
  <br>
  Force anonymity will disable the name field completely. Role signature can
  still be used for an user to identify himself to some extent.
  <br>
  By default, users can be identified inside threads by an unique id that will
  use the user's ip. This behavior can be disabled by checking the option to
  disable thread-wise ids.
  <br>
  If the site owner enables archiving, the thread pages are archived if the
  board option to archive content is enabled.
  <br>
  The [code] tag allows for posts to transform text in this tag into a
  non-formated text that is best used to display code.
  <br>
  The name used for anonymous posters, board name and description can also be
  changed.
  <br>
  Board message will be displayed above the posting form and accepts any most of
  posting markdown plus custom links using [displayed text](address).

  <h1>Filters</h1>
  Filters change a term for another term.

  <h1>Banners</h1>
  One can add customized banners for a board, they will be displayed randomly
  for users.

  <h1>Rules</h1>
  Rules can be written and will be made visible on the rules.html page of the
  board.

  <h1>Board message markdown</h1>
  It is similar to standard posting markdown with some differences:
  <br>
  It won't handle quotes.
  <br>
  Links won't be handled the same way, you have to use standard markdown for
  them.
  <br>
  For example: [A link](http://hurr.durr) becomes
  <a href="http://hurr.durr">A link</a>
  <br>
  [code] tag won't be applied.
