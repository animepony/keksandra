  <h1>Tripcodes</h1>
  To use a tripcode, add a # in your name. After the #, add the password for the
  tripcode.
  <br>
  The server will apply a hash to the password and display the hashed password.
  <br>
  To use a secure tripcode, add ## in your name and a password. A secure
  tripcode will generate a random text to be displayed that will only be used if
  your password matches.

  <br>
  <br>

  <h1>Role signature</h1>
  If you wish to display your global or board role when posting, you can put #rs
  in your name, like a tripcode, case insensitive. This will prevent you from
  using a tripcode.
  <br>
  You can also enable in your account settings to always use role signature.
  <br>
  <br>
  <h1>Markdown</h1>
  When posting you can use some tools that will enhance its text in HTML.

  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>Greentext</h3>
  If you add a > in the start of a line, it will greentext the text until it
  finds a new line.
  <br>
  Example:
  <br>
  <span class="greenText">>le ebin upboat :^)</span>

  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>Quote</h3>
  If you write >> and then a number to a posting, it will create a link to this
  post in the board you are posting and add a tooltip with the post preview if
  you have javascript enabled.
  <br>
  Example:
  <br>
  <a href="">>>50</a>

  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>Board link</h3>
  If you write >>> and then add a board name between slashes, it will create a
  link to the board.
  <br>
  Example:
  <br>
  <a
    href=""
    class="quoteLink">>>>/cancer/</a>

  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>Cross-quote</h3>
  It is also possible to quote posts from another boards. Just add the posting
  number after the board name.
  <br>
  Example:
  <br>
  <a
    href=""
    class="quoteLink">>>>/cancer/50</a>

  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>Spoiler</h3>
  If you add your text between [spoiler] and [/spoiler], it will hide your text
  to be only revealed when hovering over it. You can't break lines between the
  tags.
  <br>
  Example:
  <br>
  <span class="spoiler">the game</span>

  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>Urls</h3>
  If you post a url starting with either http or https, it will automatically be
  linked.
  <br>
  Example:
  <br>
  <a href="">http://bot.net</a>
</body>
