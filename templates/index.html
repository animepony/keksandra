  <h1>LynxChan, the best engine you will ever shitpost with.</h1>
  Welcome to the live beta of LynxChan. This site is meant to let people explore
  the engine and experiment it in an actual deploy with all its features
  enabled.
  <br>
  <h3>Technologies</h3>
  LynxChan uses Io.js as a runtime environment and Mongodb as a database. It is
  meant to focus on high levels of concurrency and performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The templates used are nothing but pure HTML, reducing development overhead.
  It also uses a modular approach to templates, allowing for ease of migration.
  It is possible to change all the templates with a single setting in the server
  configuration.
  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  I have noticed that many chans struggle with hosting costs. In my opinion,
  that is a very real obstacle for hosting a chan. So I have developed an engine
  from scratch that is meant to enable more people to host their chans.
  <br>
  <br>
  I believe that chans are one of the last kind of sites where people still have
  freedom of speech in the internet, away from centralized corporative control,
  so I see the existence of chans as something important for the future of the
  internet as a whole. Serious business.
  <br>
  <br>
  This site is not meant to build a community, so any kind of content that might
  cause issues with my host will be deleted and the user banned,
  <b>even if I agree with said content.</b>
  <br>
  Sorry for that, but I just want to avoid any issues while I am just trying to
  let people know about this project.
  <br>
  Maybe in the future I will put myself on the line for freedom of speech like

    target="blank">hotwheels</a> did, but not today.
  <h3>Goals</h3>
  1. Support users not using javascript for the basic functions.
  <br>
  2. Provide every functionality through a json based RPC.
  <br>
  3. Support the most amount of users with the least hardware power.
  <br>
  4. Having a modular front-end so people can easily create and use different
  templates.
